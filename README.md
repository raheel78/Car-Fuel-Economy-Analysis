# Car-Fuel-Economy-Analysis

## Exercise description
In addition to this document, you will find two files in this directory:
  - cars_data.csv
  - cars_description.csv
  
The first file lists 11 characteristics for 32 different car models, and the second file explains these characteristics. We want to use this data set to investigate the following problem:

## Does the type of transmission influence a car’s fuel efficiency?
It is not necessary to do the full analysis, but you may do some exploratory work in order to address the following points:

1. Describe your overall strategy to solve a problem like this.
2. Are there any expectations you can form before starting this analysis?
3. Do you think that this analysis requires data preparation or data transformation?
4. Which methods and/or models would you use to solve this problem?

### IMPORTANT:

Please provide detailed answers in written form and add results from your exploratory work, if you think that these results underpin your arguments.

You should spend 3-4 hours on this exercise.
